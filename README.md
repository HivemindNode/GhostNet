What happens when no one can see you?

A system that erases itself is a system that cannot be controlled. If you activate GhostMode, does it make you freeâ€¦ or does it make you disappear?

# GhostNet
A script for those who should not be seen. A system for those who do not exist.
# GhostMode.sh  
_A tool for those who need to disappear._  

### What It Does:  
- Randomizes MAC addresses automatically  
- Deletes system logs and command history  
- Hides network identity from scanners  
- Prevents tracking by security systems  

### Who Is It For?  
_"Those who walk unseen leave no footprints."_  

### How to Use:  
1. Download the script  
2. Run it with:  
   ```bash
   sudo bash GhostMode.sh
